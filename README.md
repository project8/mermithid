# mermithid

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/122257399.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/122257399) [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/mermithid/badge/?version=latest)](https://mermithid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

Mermithid is an extension of [morpho](https://github.com/morphoorg/morpho) that contains processors specific to Project 8 analysis, spectrum fitting and plotting.

## Requirements

You will need to install via a package manager (such as apt-get):

- python (3.x; 2.7.x support not guaranteed)
- python-pip
- git
- ROOT (Cern) with pyROOT

## Installation

After cloning mermithid, run `git submodule update --init --recursive`.

These are two possible ways of installing and working with mermithid: Using a virtual environment, or with docker.

### Virtual environment installation

1. Cicada and Phylloxera need to be installed in a sub directory:

  ```bash
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make -j3
  make -j3 install
  ```

2. These libraries need to be added to your PYTHONPATH:

  ```bash
  echo "export PYTHONPATH=${PWD}/build:$PYTHONPATH" >> ~/.bash_profile
  ```

3. Install mermithid:

  ```bash
  pip install . -e ./morpho
  ```

   (The `-e ./morpho` is here to install morpho as an egg.)

### Docker installation

Docker provides a uniform test bed for development and bug testing. Please use this environment to testing/resolving bugs.

1. Install Docker (Desktop version): <https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/>
2. Clone and pull the latest master version of mermithid
3. Inside the mermithid folder, execute `docker-compose run mermithid`. The container prompter should appear at the end of the installation. A directory (`mermithid_share`) should be created in your home and mounted under the `/host` folder: you can modify this by editing the docker-compose file.
4. When reinstalling, you can remove the image using `docker rmi mermithid_mermithid`

### Running mermithid

In both cases, you need to set the paths right for using these software. For example in the docker container:

```bash
source $MERMITHID_BUILD_PREFIX/setup.sh
source $MERMITHID_BUILD_PREFIX/bin/this_cicada.sh
source $MERMITHID_BUILD_PREFIX/bin/this_phylloxera.sh
```

## Quick start and examples

Mermithid works a-la morpho, where the operations on data are defined using processors. Each processor should be defined with a name, then should have its attributes configured using a dictionary before being run. Examples of how to use mermithid can be found in the "tests" folder.
